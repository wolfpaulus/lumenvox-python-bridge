            <h2>How it works</h2>

            <p>
                The Idea behind OTS is that the important ideas in an article are described with
                many of the same words while redundant information uses less technical terms
                and is not related to the main subject of the article. Important lines are lines
                that are related to the subject of the article. The subject of the article is the
                list of ideas that are most discussed in the article.
                In practice , the article is scanned once and a list of all of the words and their
                occurrence in the text is stored in a list. After sorting this list by the
                occurrence of words in the text we will see a list similar to this:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>11 are</li>
                <li>17 is</li>
                <li>16 a</li>
                <li>14 Harry</li>
                <li>14 on</li>
                <li>13 Sally</li>
                <li>11 Love</li>
                <li>11 such</li>
                <li>4 an</li>
                <li>2 taxi</li>
                <li>1 university</li>
                <li>1 chicago</li>
                <li>1 meets</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </uL>

            <p>
                Now we will remove all the words that are common in the English language using a
                dictionary file. Example of such words: "The","a","since","after","will".
                These words are words that don't teach us anything about the subject of the article.
                Knowing that the word "Police" is in a given text can tell us that the article might
                talk about the police , however knowing that the word "will" is in the text can't
                teach us anything about the subject of the text.
            </p>

            <p>After removing the redundant words the new list will look like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>14 Harry</li>
                <li>13 Sally</li>
                <li>11 Love</li>
                <li>2 taxi</li>
                <li>1 university</li>
                <li>1 chicago</li>
                <li>1 meets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                From this list we may assume that the text talks about "Harry , Sally , Love".
                So an important sentence in the text will be a sentence that talks about Harry,
                Sally and Love. A sentence that talks about the university of Chicago may be
                neglected because we find the word "chicago" only once in the text, so we may assume
                that "chicago" is not one of the main ideas in the text. Each sentence is given
                a grade based on the the keywords in it. A line that holds many important words will
                be given a high grade. To produce a 20% summary we print the top 20% sentences with
                the highest grade.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ots will not work on books because they cover too many topics. however, each
                page may be fed individually, this will produce a good result. Poems or other
                non-standard texts will not produce a good result because they are structured
                in a "funny" way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every new language to be implemented needs to contain a list of VERY common words
                in the language. 250 words is more than enough. See en.dic for example. Writing such
                a dictionary is an iteratice process. It is suggested that the author of such a
                dictionary will try to scan a few articles using OTS and try it with the "--keywords"
                flag on. This will tell him if OTS thinks for some reason that "his" is the subject
                of the text. If this is the case then "his" needs to be added to the dictionary.
            </p>

            <h3>Stemming</h3>

            <p>
                Stemming is the ability to take a word such as "running" and trace it back to its
                original form to the word "run". We use this feature to group together all of the
                the derivatives of a certain words. Now what we group together these words
                ots will know what the subject of this article is the one word "run" and not
                ("running","run", "runnable" ...). Now, when we encounter a sentence that talks
                about some "runner" we will know to that it is related to the topic of the article.

                In previous versions this has never been done because "running"!="run";

                The stemming support is now integrated into OTS. To allow stemming I had to create a new
                file format that will hold the stemming rules. That format is XML based. libxml2 is being used.
